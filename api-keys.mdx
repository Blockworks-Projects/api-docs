```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://rest.staging.blockworksresearch.com/v3/assets
```

## Managing Your API Keys

<Warning>
  **API Key Management Dashboard Coming Soon**

  We're building a comprehensive dashboard where you'll be able to:
  - View your API keys
  - Generate new keys
  - Rotate existing keys
  - Monitor usage and rate limits
  - Manage permissions
</Warning>

### Current Key Management

For now, API key management is handled through our support team:

- **New Keys**: Contact [support@blockworksresearch.com](mailto:support@blockworksresearch.com)
- **Key Rotation**: Email us to rotate your existing keys
- **Usage Monitoring**: Request usage reports from our team

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep Keys Secret" icon="lock">
    Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Environment Variables" icon="shield">
    Store API keys in environment variables, not in your source code
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate Regularly" icon="refresh">
    Rotate your API keys periodically for enhanced security
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Usage" icon="eye">
    Keep track of your API usage to detect any unusual activity
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Environment Variables

Store your API key securely using environment variables:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
// Use environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.BLOCKWORKS_API_KEY;

const response = await fetch('https://rest.staging.blockworksresearch.com/v3/assets', {
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': apiKey,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import os
import requests

# Use environment variables
api_key = os.getenv('BLOCKWORKS_API_KEY')

headers = {
    'x-api-key': api_key,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://rest.staging.blockworksresearch.com/v3/assets',
    headers=headers
)
```

```bash Environment Setup
# Set in your .env file
BLOCKWORKS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Or export in your shell
export BLOCKWORKS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

</CodeGroup>

## Rate Limits

API keys come with different rate limits based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests per Hour | Requests per Day |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Starter | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Professional | 10,000 | 100,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

<Note>
  Rate limits are enforced per API key. If you exceed your limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized">
    This usually means your API key is invalid or missing. Check that you're including the `x-api-key` header with your requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests">
    You've exceeded your rate limit. Wait for the rate limit to reset or consider upgrading your plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden">
    Your API key doesn't have permission to access this resource. Check your plan limits or contact support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Getting Help

If you're having trouble with your API key:

1. **Check your plan limits** - Ensure you're not exceeding your rate limits
2. **Verify your key** - Make sure you're using the correct API key
3. **Contact support** - Email [support@blockworksresearch.com](mailto:support@blockworksresearch.com) for assistance

## Data API: Blockworks Data, Anywhere

Even the best dashboard can only take you so far. Sometimes, you need direct access to the numbers in your own environment: feeding models, powering tools, automating the boring stuff.

Your models, dashboards, and reporting pipelines are starving for rock-solid onchain data, yet you’re still babysitting CSVs and wrestling with unreliable sources.

We’re unclogging that pipe today. Blockworks Data API connects our entire warehouse straight to your stack so you can build, ship, and iterate at lightning speed.

### Why Data API?

Earlier this year, we promised two flavors of access: customize inside, retrieve outside. Dashboard Builder nailed the first, Data API delivers the second.

With the Blockworks Data API, you’ll be able to:

- **Pull what you need, when you need it.** No copy-paste, no manual exports.
- **Integrate anywhere.** Python notebooks, Excel models, BI dashboards, cron jobs, in-house apps.
- **Trust the source.** Every call hits the same validated warehouse that powers Blockworks Research.
- **Go deep when it matters.** Pull the complete onchain story in a single call, powered by proprietary metrics that reveal what really drives a protocol.

From daily reporting to backtesting to automating investor updates, the possibilities are wide open.

### Rollout Plan

- **Private beta:** A select group of partners will get early access over the coming weeks.
- **Waitlist now open:** We’ll expand access gradually as we scale infrastructure and refine endpoints. [Join the waitlist here](https://blockworksco.typeform.com/api-waitlist).

### The Bigger Picture

Blockchain transparency should make rigorous analysis easier. Today, data collection and cleanup still waste too many hours.

The Data API is our next step in removing that friction so you can spend less time wrangling and more time acting.


<Note>To access Blockworks APIs, head over to [blockworksresearch.com](https://www.blockworksresearch.com)</Note>


The Blockworks API gives you direct programmatic access to the same high-quality crypto datasets that power our editorial and research platforms.
Our team of engineers, researchers, and analysts does the hard work of blockchain indexing, metric design, and data cleaning - so you can focus on building insights, charts, products, and tools.

| What you get | Description
| - | - |
| Aggregated blockchain metrics | Consistent, documented time-series across chain activity, fees, issuance, stablecoins, DEX volumes, and more. Aggregated mostly to daily values for comparability.
| Chart dataset exports | Programmatic access to 1,500+ datasets used in Blockworks Research dashboards.
| Asset profiles & prices | Up-to-date market data (price, market cap, volume, supply) alongside curated asset profiles.

## Why it’s different

Most providers hand you raw events and leave modeling to you. We’re opinionated: crypto engineers, researchers, and analysts do the heavy lifting — indexing chains, cleaning anomalies, decoding events, and codifying methodology — so you consume stable, versioned metrics out of the box.

- Curated metrics defined and maintained by subject-matter experts
- Methodology-driven with explicit lineage and source references
- Consistent schemas and naming across chains and assets
- The exact datasets behind our editorial and research platforms

## What to expect

- Fast onboarding: metrics are ready to use with minimal transformation
- Clear docs: each dataset includes definitions, units, and methodology notes
- Reliable delivery: built for high availability and consistent updates
- Scalable integration: suitable for investment memos, custom charts, dashboards, analytics tools, trading models, and research pipelines

## Example metric categories

These examples illustrate scope; see the metrics catalog for full definitions and methodology notes.

- Price & supply: `token_price_usd`, `token_supply`, `token_fdv`
- Economic value & fees: `rev_total`, `rev_total_usd`, `transaction_fees`, `base_fees`, `priority_fees`, `other_fees`, `mev_tips`, `burn`
- Activity & costs: `transaction_total`, `transaction_success`, `transaction_fail`, `address_total`, `fee_average`, `fee_median` (and USD variants)
- Stablecoins: `stablecoin_supply`, `stablecoin_circulating`
- DEX: `spot_volume_usd`


## Who it’s for

- Institutional investors needing reliable, consistent metrics for due diligence & branded charting
- Teams building executive dashboards or internal KPIs across chains
- Quant researchers running screens and backtests
- Analysts reproducing and extending Blockworks Research charts
- Product teams enriching asset pages with reliable metrics

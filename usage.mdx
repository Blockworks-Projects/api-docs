Our API usage is tracked **on a team scope**. This means:

- If your team has **multiple API keys**, all requests made with any of those keys are **counted together**.
- If your team has **multiple users**, each request from any user counts towards the same team-wide rate limit and monthly usage allowance.

## Included Monthly Usage

We are launching the API with the following allowance:

- **2,500 monthly requests** included in the **Standard Blockworks Research plan**.

All requests across your team will be counted toward this limit.

## Temporary Launch Policy

For our initial launch phase:

- Pricing for dedicated API plans will be announced in the coming months.
- Until then, **users are welcome to test the API** freely within the included allowance.
- We encourage feedback via our in-app form: [Share Feedback](https://app.blockworksresearch.com/?modal=share-feedback).

## Need More Than 2,500 Requests?

If you anticipate exceeding the included allowance:

- Reach out to our **Sales** or **Support** teams to discuss extended access.
- We may be able to grant additional temporary capacity while we finalize dedicated API plans.

## Tracking Usage

Soon you'll be able to track your current usage in your Blockworks Research [**API Key Management**](https://app.blockworksresearch.com/settings/api-keys) page. Usage is updated in near real-time so you can plan accordingly.

> **Tip:** If you have scripts or integrations running frequently, consider caching results where possible to avoid unnecessary usage.

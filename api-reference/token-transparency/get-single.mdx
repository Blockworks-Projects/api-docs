## Transparency Framework Categories

The Blockworks Token Transparency Framework evaluates projects across four key areas:

### Project & Team (Max: 10 points)
Evaluates team transparency, background disclosure, and governance structure.

### Token Allocation (Max: 18 points)
Assesses clarity around token distribution, vesting schedules, and allocation percentages.

### Market Structure (Max: 7 points)
Reviews market making arrangements, liquidity provisions, and trading mechanics.

### Financial Disclosure (Max: 5 points)
Measures transparency of financial operations, revenue models, and treasury management.

## Total Score Calculation

The total transparency score is calculated by summing all category ratings. In this example:
- Project & Team: 10/10
- Token Allocation: 17/18
- Market Structure: 7/7
- Financial Disclosure: 4/5
- **Total: 38/40 (95%)**

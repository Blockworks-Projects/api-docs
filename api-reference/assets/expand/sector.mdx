### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | number | Unique sector identifier |
| `title` | string | Sector title (e.g., L1, DeFi) |
| `created_at` | number | Unix timestamp when sector was created |

## Notes

- Can be used with other expansion options by joining with a comma (e.g. `?expand=markets,ohlcv_last_24_h`).
- Can be used on `/v1/assets/` or `/v1/assets/{idOrSlug}` endpoints.
- `price` and `market_cap` are expanded by default in `/assets/{idOrSlug}` results unless an explicit `?expand=` flag is provided.

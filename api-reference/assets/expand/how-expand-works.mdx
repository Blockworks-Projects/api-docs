## Overview

The `?expand=` parameter allows you to include additional related data in your asset responses, primarily
used to reduce API calls.  To include more than one option, use a comma-separated list, such as `?expand=price,market_cap`.

<Note>
  This behavior applies to both the `/v1/assets` **(Get Multiple Assets)** and `/v1/assets/{idOrSlug}` **(Get Single Asset)** endpoints.
</Note>

<Note>
  When fetching a single asset, the `price` and `market_cap` data are included by default.
</Note>

## Example Request

```bash
GET /v1/assets/ethereum?expand=markets
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "code": "ETH",
  "title": "Ethereum",
  "slug": "ethereum",
  "tag_line": "A decentralized computing platform",
  ... // other asset data

    "total_liquidations": 0,
    "updated_at": 1760631722
  }
}
```

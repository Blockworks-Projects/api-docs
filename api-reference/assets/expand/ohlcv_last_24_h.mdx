## Notes

- Can be used with other expansion options by joining with a comma (e.g. `?expand=markets,ohlcv_last_24_h`).
- Can be used on `/v1/assets/` or `/v1/assets/{idOrSlug}` endpoints.
- `price` and `market_cap` are expanded by default in `/assets/{idOrSlug}` results unless an explicit `?expand=` flag is provided.

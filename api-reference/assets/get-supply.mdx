  "liquid": 0,
  "total": 120702572.39159,
  "asset_code": "ETH",
  "asset_slug": "ethereum"
}
```

| `liquid` | number | Liquid supply amount |
| `total` | number | Total token supply including locked tokens |
| `asset_code` | string | Asset code (e.g., "ETH") |

## Notes

- This endpoint is equivalent to using `?expand=supply` on the `/v1/assets/{idOrSlug}` endpoint, but returns only the supply data.
- The response includes `asset_code` and `asset_slug` for easy identification.
